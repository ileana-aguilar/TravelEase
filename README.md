# Getting started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ileana-aguilar/TravelEase.git
   cd travelease

3. **Create a supabase account**
   - add your api key to client.js
   
5. **Install dependencies**
```
npm install
```

**Run the application in developer mode**

```
npm run dev
```

**Open project in the browser**

In the command line Vite will display a link, such as http://127.0.0.1:5173 to click on or copy/paste that will take you to the localhost port where the project is running.

**Tip:** If you'd like to stop the server, you can use ctrl + c or cmd + c within the Terminal, or use the trash can icon in the top right of the Terminal within VS Code. To run the server again, simply use npm run dev again.
